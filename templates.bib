%% The templates shown here were extracted from a large number of different bibtex files.
%% Some of the fields found the files were not output to the template, being rare or strange.

%% Fields are sorted descending by the number of occurrences in the files, i.e., most common first.

%% Some fields have double braces {{}} to retain capitalisation in the entry

%% Some fields have \footnotesize{\url{}} to be friendly to underscore and long urls
